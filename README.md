# How it works
Well it is pretty easy.
Firtly, Enter your desired key( any integer ).
Secondly, Select Chose file and chose your file.
Thats it.
Your File has been "encrypted".
Anyone anonymous will not know what is in the original file without decrpyting - that requires two this 1. This software 2. Key you Entered


How to Decrpt
Enter the same key u used for encrption and select the same file. "Tada"
Your original file is retained.

 # Also
You can add more layers oof encryption by encrypting file n times by using unique key every time.
it will be Decrypted  by decrypting it n time by entering keys respectively in reverse order.

# Any other combination or entering wrong key will lead to fail in decryption 
# Can be used to encrpt any file format like jpg,png,txt etc.
